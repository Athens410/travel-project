    <div class="video">The concept for Bestia juxtaposes decorative contemporary elements against a raw, industrial space dripping with
    character. This approach pays homage to sophisticated modern-day Italian spaces, which often integrate contemporary
    interiors into centuries-old structures. Strong, traditional building materials such as tile, steel, marble, and wood
    also provide pops of festive color. The name Bestia (Italian for “Beast”) echoes throughout the space via hard-edged
    design elements, such as the wall covering’s pattern of bar-fight weapons, intimidating meat-hook chandeliers suspended
    from soaring steel tracks, and bathroom tile work that reads as unfinished.<a href="
